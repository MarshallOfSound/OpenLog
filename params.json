Now errors and stack traces that happen on any machine will be readily available to you.    \r\n###Tiny overhead, client-side plugin is < 1kb gzipped!!!  \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n#####Simple\r\n1. Download the latest release from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/OpenLog/releases)\r\n2. Include the `dist/capture.min.js` file on any page you want to capture the errors and logs for  \r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/capture.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\"></script>\r\n    ```  \r\n3. Upload the entire release directory to your server and from the root OpenLog directory run\r\n\r\n    ````bash\r\n    npm install\r\n    node server/server.js\r\n    ````\r\n4. Access your instance of OpenLog at http://your-domain.here:4783, the default login credentials are\r\n\r\n    ````\r\n    username: openlog\r\n    password: password\r\n    ````\r\n5. That's it... No, seriously, that is it :)\r\n\r\n#####Advanced\r\n1. Download the latest release from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/OpenLog/releases)\r\n2. You can customise a few parts of OpenLog by modifying the `config.inc.json` in the root OpenLog directory.  You can change the `user` and `password` values.  As well as changing the port that OpenLog runs on.\r\n3. Once you have modified those values you can build you own version of OpenLog by running these commands in the root OpenLog directory\r\n\r\n    ````bash\r\n    npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n    npm install\r\n    grunt build\r\n    ````\r\n\r\n4. You can now include the `dist/capture.min.js` file on any page you want to capture the errors and logs for\r\n\r\n   ````html\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/capture.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\"></script>\r\n    ````\r\n5. Upload the entire OpenLog directory **(leave behind `node_modules`)** to your server and from the root OpenLog directory run\r\n\r\n    ````bash\r\n    npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n    npm install\r\n    grunt build\r\n    node  server/server.js\r\n    ````\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n------------\r\nIf you are already logging using `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn` and `console.error` then OpenLog requires no extra work at all.  It will capture errors globally on your page and listen to calls to the above `console` functions.  \r\n\r\nIf you aren't currently logging using those functions you can either start logging with those functions, or call the OpenLog functions which are.  \r\n`Log.info(arguments)`, `Log.warn(arguments)`, `Log.error(arguments)`.  `Log` is a globally defined object\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to capture certain logging types you simply add a `data-capture` parameter to the script tag that loaded the `capture.min.js` file and set it to be the types of logs you wish to capture.  For instance if you only want error logs\r\n`data-capture=\"error\"`, or if you want error and warning logs `data-capture=\"warn error\"`.\r\n\r\nIf your server is not runinng in the expected / default location (the hostname the script is included on at port 4783) you can specify the logging URL by setting a `data-log-url=\"<YOUR URL HERE>\"` attribute on the script tag that loaded the `capture.min.js`.\r\n\r\nUpdating OpenLog\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nFancy, smooth, no data loss updating method coming soon :)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAll PR's and issues are welcomed with open arms, just fork make your magical new feature or bugfix and throw up a PR to master.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n`node.js` > 0.10\r\n`npm`\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSamuel Attard - <me@samuelattard.com> - <https://twitter.com/marshallofsound> - <https://www.samuelattard.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOpenLog is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
